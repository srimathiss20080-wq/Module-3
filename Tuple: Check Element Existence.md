# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
x = ('a', 'b', 'n', 5, 8, 3)

print('n' in x)
 print(8 in x)
```

## Result
Thus To write a Python program that checks if the element 'n' and the element 8 exist within a given tuple. Hence the code has been executed successfully.
